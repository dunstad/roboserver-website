If you're just sending charcoal from your tree farm to generators, maybe this is all you need. But with a more advanced item storage system, you're going to be laying a lot of pipes."},

If you want to link some new machine or location to your item network, it's up to you to make that happen right now. Of course, robots (also called turtles) can do almost anything a player can.

Maybe it's a hopper machine to produce chickens so you don't have to worry about food. Or perhaps a mob farm, to help you avoid combat and focus on building. Of course, learning how to configure machines and design redstone contraptions takes time too. If you're staying small scale, you might not need automation at all.

This is why we swap out pickaxes for quarries, and it's why the logical next step is to tell our robots what we want done, and let them work out how. This could involve the robots setting up quarries or farms from blueprints, making warehouses to store output, and potentially even creating more robots to speed help things along. All things you've done plenty before, so why not give yourself a break and take your automation to the next level?"},

Have you ever had a great idea for a factory, structure, or even landscape, but not enough time or dedication to see it through? In the future, just describe it to your AI and enjoy the fruits of no labor. While this sort of thing isn't possible today, it might be closer than you think. Software such as Tensorflow makes it easier than ever to apply machine learning techniques to our problems."},
